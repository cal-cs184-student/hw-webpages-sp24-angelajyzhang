<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>
  The aim of our project is to develop new shaders for Minecraft which allows for a more realistic gaming experience in terms of 
  how water is presented to the player. In particular, we are trying to make water look more realistic with regards to color shifting 
  at various positions of the player, refraction, and reflection. Our project aims to understand how light rays work within the Minecraft 
  world and to use those rays’s incoming angles to the surface normal to implement air-water refraction and reflection using the Fresnel equation.
  Lastly, we are hoping to make the water more dynamic and showcase some properties of flow or movement. This entire project puts into practice 
  the concepts we learned in class about shaders, ray tracing (to mimic reflection), and texture mapping.
</p>
<br>

<h3 align="middle">Technical Approach</h3>
    <p>
      One of the early problems we encountered was that the pre-existing code of how Minecraft shaders were implemented were scarce online, 
      and there was overall very little documentation we could reference to help us get started. Thus, we turned to using a Minecraft clone called 
      Craft in order to give ourselves a foundation where we can add shaders and other components. This Minecraft clone worked on multiple devices, and 
      already used GLSL for its existing default light dynamics so this made it easier for us to implement changes within their GLSL files.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, another problem soon emerged and we realized that the code itself in the clone was all written in C, so allocation, creation of pointers, 
      and function declarations were all novel to us (especially when implementing depth order sorting in the semi transparent data buffer). The clone’s GitHub also contained no comments or documentation, so there was a steep learning curve 
      for us in terms of self-learning the implementation of the Minecraft world in Craft. This was done through scavenging through GLSL files and the other
      compilation files of the original code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we realized that this clone does not come with water blocks, meaning that the default properties of water had to be implemented from scratch by us 
      first, before we were able to do further refraction or reflection properties. From here, we decided we realistically needed to limit the scope of our 
      project and focus on creating our own textured block in Craft, give it transparency, and then add some refraction and reflective properties as the last step.
    </p>

    <h4 align="middle">Implementing water semi-transparency</h4>

    <p>
      Our initial approach to transparency attempted to use the built textures in the way glass implemented. Glass was "transparent" in this world because 
      the pixels within its bounds simply don't render. We attempted to do the same, but this only resulted in swiss cheese like water as seen below

  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<br>
      From here we realized that we must use our understanding of OpenGl to adjust shaders accordingly. As such we adjusted the block fragment shaders
  to lower the alpha value. While some blocks were transparent, this led to a new issue where some blocks behind the transparent blocks simply wouldn't render. 
  This is because the camera thinks that we can't "see" them. 

  In order to resolve this, we had to dig into the order in which glsl renders chunks. Currently, it was generating the transparent blocks before the blocks behind it, which meant that they 
  blocks behind are not visible to the player due to the block in front occluding it. As such, we had to adjust the code to render transparent blocks last, so that the blocks behind it are fully rendered


    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr align="center">
            <td>
                <img src="./images/73563902722__1F87A15E-B20E-4EAC-9443-BBF96071DE42.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption>There are empty blocks behind the water block, as is seen here. They are not rendered when they should be</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <table style="width:100%">


      When tackling how to implement the semi-transparency of our water block, we needed to modify both the world data generation and the entire graphics 
      rendering pipeline. 
      This task deemed to be much more complex and challenging than we thought, as it required creating separate buffers—one for opaque 
      blocks and one for semi-transparent blocks—and a sorting algorithm to sort semi-transparent objects in depth from farther to nearest distance from the 
      camera (the player’s view).
      This process resulted in a lot of debugging, especially with segmentation faults that came from our sorting algorithm, which consumed a large portion of our 
      development timeline and pushed us behind schedule a bit. In general much of our time was spent digging through this poorly documented to understand how it worked.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, the transparency was working (we could see the blocks behind), however the faces in between neighboring water blocks were being rendered, 
      albeit semi transparent. This was an easy fix; just some logic that would render the faces if the neighboring block isn’t opaque or water. 
      Finally, we have transparency!
    </p>

    <h4 align="middle">Implementing shader for refraction and reflection</h4>

    <p>
      In order to implement refraction properties of our water, we used the Fresnel equation to do so. We wrote this part of the code in our 
      block_fragment.glsl shader. In the shader, we began by declaring uniform variables, including some textures, matrices, and some other 
      integer/float variables. The main() method in this shader fetches the color of the texture of that fragment using the sampler textures and the 
      fragment_uv coordinates. It then checks whether or not this color is part of the a cloud (which may end up resulting in a masking effect) and then 
      adjusts the diffuse and ambient occlusion accordingly. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, the code checks the uv coordinates of the texture based on fragment_uv and if it falls within the water texture, it applies waves, slight distortions, and the fresnel effect. To create the waves, we were initially going to implement vertex displacement, but since each face only has six vertices, we would have had to completely change the mesh representation. Thus, we decided to simulate water waves by using timers to induce a sliding effect of the texture. It wraps around as it reaches the end of the texture. On top of this, we created a sin() based color pulse based on location to cause the sliding waves to look slightly more realistic and dynamic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, to add refraction properties, we calculated the Fresnel term based on the following equations:
    </p>

            <img src="./images/fresnel1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            <figcaption>How the reflection and refraction rays are positioned.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Linear Interpolation of lower and upper bounds to get the final transparency value.</figcaption>
        </td>

    <p>
      We used the refraction coefficients of water (1.0) and air (1.33) in order to simulate the refractive behavior of light traveling through them. Using dot products, exponential scaling, and linear interpolation (for lower and upper bounds of the effect), we could then set the alpha value of the render to the result of the fresnel effect, causing it to variably be opaque or semi transparent depending on the viewing angle. In addition, the code fetches a part of the sky color from the sky_sampler texture based on the reflection angle calculated in the fresnel code. The refraction angle is used to fetch another color from a different water texture, causing some distortion. Lastly, we mixed the reflected and refracted colors into the final color (after waves) using the Fresnel term and stored that color in gl_FragColor as the final value.
    </p>

  

    <h3 align="middle">Lessons we learned</h3>

    <p>
      First, we learned that creating semi-transparency that can display further opaque or semi transparent blocks from scratch was quite difficult. 
      Working on this portion of the project made us much more accustomed with the OpenGL rendering pipeline and of the techniques used to generate the data 
      that is passed into the buffers.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second lesson we learned in our process was that implementing the Fresnel effect, reflection, and texture manipulation / distortion for waves occurred 
      in the OpenGl GLSL files themselves. We learned how to vary texture sample uv coordinates with time to achieve “moving” renders and how using 
      sin() waves can create more dynamic effects. We also learned how much fine tuning needs to go into choosing constants when rending water.

    <p>Our project ended up having quite different results than we had initially expected. This stemmed from the need to create transparency from scratch and from the current implementation of the triangle mesh on each block face. As such, the majority of our time was spent working on redesigning the entire pipeline. However, as you can see in the above pictures, we were still able to implement some traditional water shader effects. This project ended up getting us to learn how data and rendering is dealt with in one of our favorite childhood games.</p>
