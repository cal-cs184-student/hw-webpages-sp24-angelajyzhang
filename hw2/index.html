<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    I really enjoyed this homework! I thought that the implementations of edgeSplit, edgeFlip, and the upsampling were quite logical and easy to 
    follow given the lectures and primers provided for us. Debugging was harder than usual here for me because there were so many vertices, edges, 
    halfedges, and faces to keep track of.

    I learned a lot about how drawing out diagrams helps a lot with debugging these mesh questions, and overall had a great time figuring things 
    out.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    de Casteljau's algorithm recursively uses linear interpolation with control points to find a point between them (depending on parameter t's value).
    This linear interpolation is then done with the successive interpolated points, and then repeated until there is one point left. This final point
    is on the Bezier curve. Using the evaluateStep function in student_code.cpp, I created a base case and then the recursive step. The base case is when
    we've reached the final point so the number of points is 1 and that final point is returned. The recursive step performs linear interpolation once and
    returns the interpolated point per set of points using the equation given in class and the parameter t.
</p>

  Insert equation here.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The way de Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces is similar in implementation to Bezier curves in part 1. Bezier surfaces
    are a grid of control points in contrast to the linear control points of Bezier curves. Thus, there are two sets of control points, denoted
    by u and v parameters, that determine the shape and curvature of Bezier surfaces. de Casteljau's algorithm first takes a look at the control
    points in the u direction and stores all their respective final points in a 3D vector. These final points form a curve in the v direction, so 
    the algorithm then calculates the final point of these points in the v direction.
</p>

<p>
  For the implementation, I defined the 3 functions in the student_code.cpp file. First, I defined the evaluateStep function, which recursively returns 
  all the intermediate points and the final point given a 3D vector of control points. Then, I defined the evaluate1D function, which directly returns 
  just the final point of a vector of points given a parameter t. Lastly, I defined the evaluate function, which first iterates through all control points 
  in the u direction, and stores all their final points in a vector, then uses the evaluate1D function in the v direction to calcualte the final point 
  of those points in the u direction.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    I mainly followed the suggestions and instructions on the spec for this question. I first initiated the weighted normal vector to be (0, 0, 0) and also initiated
    the starting halfedge as h. I noticed in the "A Primer on the HalfEdgeMesh class" page that do-while loops were used to iterate through vertices or halfedges until
    a condition was met. I decided to use a do-while loop in my implementation as well and stop iterating through the faces once we arrive back at the starting 
    halfedge.
</p>

<p>
  Within the do-while loop, I first stored the 3 vertices of the current face into three vectors -- v1, v2, and v3 -- and used these vertices to compute two vectors 
  that lie on the face (v2 - v1 and v3 - v2). As mentioned beautifully in the spec, the cross product of these two vectors would produce a third vector that is 
  perpendicular to the face -- the normal vector of the face. I then used .norm() to normalize this vector and added it to the weighted normal vector weight_unit. 
  Then, I would reassign h to a halfedge on the next face and repeat this process until all the faces have had their normal vectors computed.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I used CMU's "Guide to Implementing Edge Operations on a Halfedge Data Structure" as a reference while implementing this function. This guide 
    was attached at the bottom of the Primer page for the Halfedge class. First, I made an if-statement to check the boundary condition stated on 
    the spec. If an edge is not on the boundary, it will continue with the rest of the operations. Second, I assigned pointers for all mesh objects 
    in the original mesh -- halfedges (inner and outer), edges, vertices, and faces. Next, I updated all pointers using Halfedge::SetNeighbors(...) based 
    on where they were pointing after the edge flip. Finally, I returned the updated e0.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout this process, drawing out all the mesh objects for both the pre-flip and post-flip meshes were super helpful, especially for 
  reassigning pointers after the flip. While coding this function, I ran into two major problems -- when I flipped an edge in the meshedit window, 
  I would see holes in the mesh and I couldn't flip the edge back. My first instinct was thinking that I assigned some pointers wrong so my debugging 
  process was mainly double checking the pointers with my drawing (I later found out it was because I assigned 2 vertices wrong in my drawing). That 
  was what helped me fix these problems.

  Not really an eventful debugging journey, but as I mentioned before I ran into two major problems -- when I flipped an edge in the meshedit window, 
  I would see holes in the mesh and I couldn't flip the edge back. My first instinct was thinking that I assigned some pointers wrong so my debugging 
  process was mainly double checking the pointers with my drawing (I later found out it was because I assigned 2 vertices wrong in my drawing). That

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    The edge split operation was implemented quite similarly to the edge flip operation. I first checked the condition that the input edge did not 
    lie on any boundary. Then, I defined all the existing mesh elements like I did in part 4. Afterward, I introduced new mesh elements that would exist 
    due to the subdivision: 1 addition vertex, 6 additional halfedges, 3 additional edges, and 2 faces. I appointed the new verte m as the midpoint by taking 
    the average of the 2 vertices of the original edge. Then, I integrated all of these new mesh elements into the original mesh my reassigning pointers using 
    setNeighbors(...). Then, I also assigned any mesh elements as isNew.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    The main issue I had is that when I flip some new edges after I got them from splitting another edge, the edge disappears.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    I did not implement support for boundary edges.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I mostly followed the steps that were described in the comments of the code. First, I updated the vertex positions before any flipping or splitting 
    and stored them in Vertex::newPosition. Each of these vertices were also flagged as 0 for their isNew attribute, denoting that they are from the 
    original mesh. I then updated the vertex positions using the formula provided in the spec ((1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum). 
</p>
<p>
  Then, I iterated over the edges of the original mesh and assigned each their new position using the formula 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D). After assigning 
  all vertices and edges in the input mesh to a new position, I performed edgeSplit and edgeFlip on the respective edges: edgeSplit only split the old edges 
  and edgeFlip only flipped edges that were created. Lastly, I copied the new vertices into Vertex::position and setting all vertices now to isNew = 0.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    Meshes seem to be more uneven and I'm also getting holes within my meshes after loop subdivision. I did notice that when I pre-split edges before upsampling, that the textures 
    did seem smoother and reduces the look of sharp corners.
